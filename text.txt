!title Definition
A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the display,
cultivation, or enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature.
The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials.
The most common form today is a residential garden, but the term garden has
traditionally been a more general one. Zoos, which display wild animals in
simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens.
Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often
signifying a shortened form of botanical garden. Some traditional types of
eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, use plants sparsely or not at all.

!title Etymology
The etymology of the word gardening refers to enclosure: it is from Middle English
gardin, from Anglo-French gardin, jardin, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High
German gard, gart, an enclosure or compound, as in Stuttgart. See Grad
(Slavic settlement) for more complete etymology. The words yard, court, and Latin
hortus (meaning "garden," hence horticulture and orchard), are cognatesâ€”all referring
to an enclosed space.
The term "garden" in British English refers to a small enclosed area of land,
usually adjoining a building. This would be referred to as a yard in American English.

!title Elements
Most gardens consist of a mix of natural and constructed elements, although even very
'natural' gardens are always an inherently artificial creation.
